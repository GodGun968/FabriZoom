# FabriZoom
(working name)

### What? 
Fork of OkZoomer v4, updated to Minecraft 1.19, ported to Kotlin, moved to different (actually maintained) GUI and configuration libraries, and updated with some code from modern OkZoomer (LibZoomer).

Will update this readme if this goes anywhere.

### Current State
Works on Fabric 1.19, but some OkZoomer functionality has yet to be re-implemented.  
The mod has undergone an almost complete rewrite, and though it is still a work in progress, it's getting close to completion.

#### Todo list before release: (~~crossed out~~ = completed)
* ~~Fix smooth zoom~~
* ~~Add config screen (SpruceUI)~~ (was Cloth Config)
* ~~Add config persistence (Configurate)~~ (was Fiber)
* ~~Re-add secondary zoom keybinds~~
* ~~Re-add zoom overlay~~
* New icon?
* New name?

### Quilt Statement
When I (trainb0y) started this project, a few mods I relied on didn't function on Quilt, so I decided to try to get some version of OkZoomer working on Fabric because the maintainer of OkZoomer had [decided to drop fabric support](https://gist.github.com/EnnuiL/79885a99e5c908010fa5eca527590b98).

For the foreseeable future I'll be trying to update this to the latest Fabric versions, even though I now primarily use Quilt as my mod loader when playing Minecraft.

This mod *should* in theory work on Quilt, but you might as well just use the original [OkZoomer](https://github.com/EnnuiL/OkZoomer).

## VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS - CHECK BACK LATER
