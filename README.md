# FabriZoom
(working name)

### What? 
Fork of OkZoomer v4, updated to Minecraft 1.19, ported to Kotlin, and updated with some code from modern OkZoomer (LibZoomer).

Will update this readme if this goes anywhere.

### Current State
Loads on Fabric 1.19, but a lot of features and configurability have been temporarily removed. However, basic zoom functionality works.

#### Todo list (before release)
* Fix smooth zoom
* Add config screen (SpruceUI) (was Cloth Config)
* Add config persistence (Configurate) (was Fiber)
* Re-add secondary zoom keybinds and other removed features.
* New icon?
* New name?

### Quilt Statement
When I (trainb0y) started this project, a few mods I relied on didn't function on Quilt, so I decided to try to get some version of OkZoomer working on Fabric because the maintainer of OkZoomer had [decided to drop fabric support](https://gist.github.com/EnnuiL/79885a99e5c908010fa5eca527590b98).

For the foreseeable future I'll be trying to update this to the latest Fabric versions, even though I now primarily use Quilt.

This mod *should* in theory work on Quilt, but you might as well just use the original [OkZoomer](https://github.com/EnnuiL/OkZoomer).

## VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS - CHECK BACK LATER
