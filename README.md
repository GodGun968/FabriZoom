# FabriZoom
(working name)

### What? 
Fork of OkZoomer v4, which I'm going to attempt to update to Fabric 1.19.  
Will update readme if this goes anywhere.

### Current State
Loads on Fabric 1.19, but cinematic camera and zoom reduced sensitivity are broken (`MouseMixin.java`)  
Basic zoom functionality works.

Also, the mod configuration is not persistent between Minecraft restarts.

### Quilt
Although the current maintainer of OkZoomer (Quilt) [doesn't wish to support fabric](https://gist.github.com/EnnuiL/79885a99e5c908010fa5eca527590b98), a few mods I rely on do not function on Quilt. Therefore, for now I'll be trying to get fabrizoom working on modern Fabric versions, as for the forseeable future I'll be using Fabric. This is not to say Quilt is bad, I think it has a lot of promise, but in my opinion it just isn't ready yet.

This mod *should* in theory work on Quilt, but you might as well just use the original [OkZoomer](https://github.com/EnnuiL/fabrizoom).

## VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS
